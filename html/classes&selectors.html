        <p>Today, Thirteenth August 2024 I'm feeling under the weather. My condition is weak and tired. Right now, its 5:29 pm. Mylo is sleeping. Baba & Aapi went outside. I'm sitting in the drawing-room. I missed my zuhar prayer today. I ate masaley wali mash ki daal in lunch. Mylo is awaken. I've to go, and boil his chicken for him because he must be hungry.</p>
